2025 NTU_Blockchain_Hackathon --- virtual track --- email classifier agent

It is pretty hard to fully make use of the transparency and tracibility of data on chain. However, I find it possible to utilize the tracilbity of blockchain to refine the prompt of LLM. I myself feel frustrated about dealing with emails and would like to use smart agents for upcoming emails when I'm busy, which could be solved with A2A workflow with the collaboration of 2 agents. I have made some progress but finally failed to achieve it due to the campus policy and API restrictions. In the demo version, I present with collecting the Gmail mails as an alternative with the logic of labeling the emails in Gmail account. The final project is set to be a C2A version.

The agent is set on https://app.virtuals.io/acp/agents, thanks for the sponsorship of $5 USDT from the host to all the teams participating in this hackathon. The agents include a buyer agent named after email requestor and a seller agent named after email summary.

The experience enables me to learn about Ollama„ÄÅFrp and ngrok, with some knowledge of server and tunnels.
